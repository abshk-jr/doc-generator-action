<h2>Brief overview</h2>
<p>OpenSCAD has no formal guidelines about tabs, spaces, etc. Try to match what exists already in the file you are working on.
</p><p>QT should be avoided in everything except GUI code. Use C++11 or boost instead. The goal is to stay modular. 
</p><p>Modularity also extends to OpenCSG and CGAL. Note the #ifdefs that attempt to separate CGAL/OpenCSG dependent code from 'independent' code. 
</p><p>There are two build systems, Qmake for the GUI and Cmake for the test suites. Please test your patch under both. Read <a class="external text" href="https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/doc/testing.txt" rel="nofollow">doc/testing.txt</a> and <a class="external text" href="https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/README.md" rel="nofollow">README.md</a>. 
</p><p>When including a new external library, please try to test it on many different systems. The GNU Compile Farm can help, as can emulator systems like Qemu or VMWare. Review the 'build-dependencies' scripts for Mac OSX and Linux/Unix (under /scripts). Try to do a cross-build to Windows if possible (see <a class="external text" href="https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/README.md" rel="nofollow">README.md</a>) 
</p>
<h2>Steps to follow to submit a patch</h2>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>Search the OpenSCAD mailing list on the topic to see if it has been previously discussed (ie. if want to add a patch for color, do a web search for 'openscad mailing list color'). Take those discussions into account when creating a patch.</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>If you are not familiar with git, read a git tutorial thoroughly (like the one at <a class="external text" href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/v1.2.6/tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">kernel.org</a>)</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>Sign up for a github account and read the introductory documentation thoroughly, for example <a class="external free" href="https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/" rel="nofollow">http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/</a></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>Make your own fork of openscad on github</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>Clone your new fork onto your local machine</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>Hack away at openscad. Test your hack.</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>Frequently merge the official openscad source back into your local copy, to avoid conflicts
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li><a class="external free" href="https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/" rel="nofollow">http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/</a> has instructions.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>Commit your changes to your local repository and push them back to your forked openscad on github</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>Run all the regression tests by reading "doc/testing.txt". Make sure your patch won't break anything. Ask the mailing list if confused.</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>If your patch adds a new feature, create a new regression test for it, and commit the test, and test result .png files, to your branch. See doc/testing.txt.</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>Update any documentation, including the RELEASE NOTES, README.md, and openscad manpage to reflect your changes, if needed. Also be prepared to update the Wiki manual.</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>When you are ready, click on the 'Pull Request' button on your fork at github. Carefully review the differences between your code and OpenSCAD Master branch.</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image:none"><li>When you are ready, submit the pull request.</li></ul>
<h2>Alternative</h2>
<p>Small patches can also be created using 'git diff' and posting to the mailing list at <a class="external text" href="http://www.openscad.org/community.html" rel="nofollow">mailing list</a> but github is vastly preferable.
